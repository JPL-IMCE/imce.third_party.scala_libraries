# IMCE Third-Party Scala Libraries

This project builds an aggregate of the Scala libraries published in the "org.scala-lang" organization
(i.e., runtime, reflection, compiler, xml, class file decoder, ...).

This aggregate facilitates using Scala-based components that have numerous third-party dependencies on Scala libraries
in Java applications that do not have an Ivy/Maven-based resolver.
